# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the FitVerse AI landing page hero section to match the bold purple + iridescent morphing blob style shown in the reference image.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current dark/gradient hero background with a solid vivid purple (#7B2FFF) full-viewport background
- Replace the existing blob/3D scene with a large, centrally placed iridescent morphing blob in React Three Fiber with vibrant multicolor gradients (pink, teal, yellow, orange) and a glossy/reflective surface that animates continuously without scroll interaction
- Display a large, bold white headline centered horizontally in the hero, overlapping the blob with the text rendering above it in z-order using a rounded/geometric sans-serif at display size (≥8rem)
- Add a minimal top navigation bar with the app name on the left and at least one nav link on the right, white text on transparent/purple background
- Add a circular rotating text badge element below the blob with a fitness/fashion tagline, slowly rotating via CSS animation, with a sparkle/star icon centered inside the ring, styled white against the purple background

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page hero immediately shows a vivid purple full-screen background with a large iridescent 3D morphing blob, bold white display headline overlapping it, a clean top nav, and a rotating circular badge below the blob — matching the bold visual style of the reference design.
