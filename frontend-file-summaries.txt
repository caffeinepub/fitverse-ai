  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main application entry point with TanStack Router; the LandingLayout no longer renders AnimatedBackground so the scroll-driven gradient in Landing.tsx is fully visible.",
  "frontend/src/lib/utils.ts": "Utility helper that exports the `cn` function combining clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional className merging throughout the app.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Wardrobe.tsx": "Complete Wardrobe AI page with simulated scanning interface (animated rings, progress bar, corner brackets), post-scan analytics dashboard showing category breakdowns and a recharts BarChart for color distribution, and global wardrobe state updates via AppContext.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useScrollProgress.ts": "Fixed scroll progress hook that correctly computes 0–1 progress for a sticky-hero pattern by dividing scrolled-past-top by (element.offsetHeight - window.innerHeight), with RAF-based updates and proper cleanup.",
  "frontend/src/components/ScrollDriven3DScene.tsx": "React Three Fiber scene featuring an organic morphing blob mesh built on IcosahedronGeometry with noise-based vertex displacement, scroll-driven color/scale transitions from magenta to purple to pink, ambient floating orbs, and multi-colored point lights for a glossy blobmixer-inspired aesthetic.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx": "Redesigned landing page with solid vivid purple (#7B2FFF) full-viewport background, ContinuousRotatingBlob centered behind the headline, large bold white \"FitVerse\" headline overlapping the blob, minimal top nav (brand left, links right), CircularTextBadge below the blob, and footer.",
  "frontend/src/components/AnimatedBackground.tsx": "Canvas-based animated background rendering a near-black (#080808) base with three slow-drifting radial gradient orbs in muted pink/purple/magenta tones, creating atmospheric depth behind the 3D blob scene.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Updated global styles with solid purple body background (#7B2FFF), cleaned-up hero headline styles (no text-shadow, large Syne font), removed scroll-driven hero container/sticky classes, and retained all inner-page and utility styles.",

  "frontend/src/components/ContinuousRotatingBlob.tsx": "Enhanced React Three Fiber blob with higher-detail IcosahedronGeometry, richer noise morphing, and six vibrant point lights (hot pink, cyan, yellow, orange, green-teal, white) plus ACESFilmic tone mapping for a vivid iridescent multicolor glossy surface.",
  "frontend/src/components/SpiralTextTransition.tsx": "New component that cycles through FitVerse words ['Fit','Style','Scan','Try','Wear'] with CSS spiral arc enter/exit animations (rotate + translate keyframes), managing word phases (entering/visible/exiting) via React state and notifying parent of word index changes.",
  "frontend/src/components/DynamicBackground.tsx": "New full-viewport fixed background component that smoothly transitions between 5 vivid colors (peach, violet, coral, teal, sky blue) synchronized with the current word index via CSS transition on backgroundColor.",
  "frontend/src/components/Web3Blob.tsx": "New React Three Fiber component rendering a glossy iridescent 3D blob with continuous Y-axis rotation, sinusoidal floating, scroll-driven upward translation, spiral twist rotation (X/Z axes scale with scroll), and geometry morphing between two noise patterns — all using delta-time lerping for cinematic smoothness.",
  "frontend/src/components/CircularTextBadge.tsx": "New SVG-based component that renders \"AI-POWERED FASHION · PERFECT FIT EVERY TIME ·\" as characters arranged in a circle, animated via requestAnimationFrame rotation, with a 4-pointed sparkle SVG icon centered inside the ring."
